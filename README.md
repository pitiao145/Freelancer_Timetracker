# Freelancer time tracker
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Short Description: Time tracker that's able to record time spent on different tasks. It will save all the activities and their timestamps to a Google spreadsheet             template. It also offers the possibility to get a list of the set of tasks performed on a day, and the total time spent on them. The program is implemented in an             easy-to-use graphical user interface and allows for modifying the link of the spreadsheet to which the data should be written.

# Problem definition and scope of the project

This project was realized in the scope of CS50's introduction to programming with Python. For this final project, I wanted to think of a real-life problem I encountered in day-to-day life and try to solve this.

Pretty quickly, I realized that, on a daily basis, I was confronted with a problem when working as a freelancer. The current project I am working on as a front-end developer requires me to keep track of the hours I spend on the project in order to be able to bill the client at the end of the month. At the same time, I am required to fill in a KPI file for the client where I write down the specific tasks I worked on, and how many hours I spent on them. Since over the course of a day, I might be working on the same tasks, but at different times of the day, I used to write down my hours manually and then add up the total time I spent on each task, to then be able to fill in the KPI sheet.

Obviously, this problem can be solved by writing down times in a spreadsheet and extrapolating the data needed for the KPIs with the spreadsheet functionalities. I am also pretty sure there would already be existing apps to do just this, but I wanted to see if I was able to leverage the power of Python in order to develop something custom-made for my own needs and way of working. Also, when working as a freelancer, you need to put in place some systems to be able to track your time and the time you spend on different tasks. Developing this time-tracker will definitely save me some work and automate some parts of the process.
